# Industry Talk 2: Project Management and System Development

The talk was held on 18 December 2025 and was given by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib who works as Head of Technology and Innovation of Serunai Commerce Sdn. Bhd. He also graduated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) and he has worked with different companies over the years.

During the talk, he emphasized that system development is the process of creating a software application rather than code writing. He mentioned that system development is similar to house building, where a clear blueprint is essential. In software, the blueprint is the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In addition, he also identified the importance of project management in system development by describing how project management effectively controls project scope, development timeline and budget.

Apart from that, Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim also introduced two common project management methodologies which are Waterfall and Agile.The Waterfall methodology applies a linear and sequential approach which is suitable for fixed-requirement projects. Although clear milestones can be offered by the Waterfall methodology, it lacks flexibility to cope with changes required.In contrast, an iterative approach is adopted by Agile methodology which contains several short development cycles known as sprints. With high flexibility and faster feedback, Agile methodology is widely used in industries.
